[00:17.80] On my way back home
[00:21.94] A chance I thought of
[00:26.10] All my favorite songs
[00:29.57] And where I'd gone wrong
[00:41.57] 
[00:35.26] The only words that I could think of
[00:40.77] I'm pissing my life away in the form of song
[00:48.97] On my way back home
[00:58.47] 
[00:57.33] A victory it was
[01:01.30] I was cheating death
[01:09.04] And just in time I woke
[01:20.54] 
[01:13.71] My memory would start to wander off
[01:20.42] And come to me
[01:23.63] The remembrance of on my way back home
[01:42.63] 
[01:54.84] I came in this way
[02:17.34] In here now I'll stay
[02:22.11] If the unknown will have to wait one more day
[02:44.61] 
[02:31.06] Cause often times then it comes out wrong
[02:37.98] But luckily, I got a mind to know
[02:44.76] On my way back home
