Word by Steven Page & Ed Robertson. Music by Ed Robertson

It's a long way back home
To pack up and leave again
Together alone
You without me again

It's a long way back home
And a long way back here again
I should have known
That you would just bleed again

For the first time I knew what to do
The first time it's just me and you
And then the worst timing I ever knew
I have to go
I already know

It's a long way back home
To feel like I'm far away
How should I know
What goes on here anyway?

For the first time I knew what to do
The first time it's just me and you
And then the worst timing I ever knew
I have to go
I already know

Why not spend a week on a star
No time, he can't get there by car
When we get some time on our own
We'll plan our next year alone

It's a long way back home
From just about anywhere
'Cause once through the door
I'm not even halfway there

For the first time I knew what to do
The first time it's just me and you
And then the worst timing I ever knew
I have to go
I already know

It's a long way back home
