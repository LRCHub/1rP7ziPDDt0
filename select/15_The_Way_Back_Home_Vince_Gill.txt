A little girl was cryin'
For her mama and her daddy
She couldn't understand why they were gone
She never knew the danger
Of talking to a stranger
Now, the girl can't find
The way back home

A little boy went walkin'
Down into the corner market
To buy a loaf of bread and an ice cream cone
He never knew the danger
Of talking to a stranger
Now, the boy can't find
The way back home

Too many kids are missing
Is anybody listening?
Won't you be the children's eyes?
They're all alone
The hardest part's not knowing
Where they are or where they're going
Won't you help the children find
The way back home?

The faces on milk cartons
Thrown away and soon forgotten
What if one of those sweet kids was your very own?
Tonight those kids are weeping
While yours are safely sleeping
Won't you help the children find
The way back home?

Too many kids are missing
Is anybody listening?
Won't you be the children's eyes?
They're all alone
The hardest part's not knowing
Where they are or where they're going
Won't you help the children find
The way back home?

Won't you help the children find
The way back home?
