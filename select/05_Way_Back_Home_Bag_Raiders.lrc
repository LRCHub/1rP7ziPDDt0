[00:01.95] Rain pours down over a city
[00:06.33] Night has fallen like a stone
[00:09.95] Are you gone or are you with me?
[00:13.84] In my heart I'll never know
[00:27.34] 
[00:17.50] If I close my eyes I'll see you
[00:21.46] Hear your footsteps in the rain
[00:25.27] In my dream I'll never find you
[00:29.01] But I'll hear you call my name
[00:44.01] 
[00:33.28] Ooooooooh
[00:37.15] Ooooooooooooooohhh
[00:46.15] 
[01:03.51] As I tread through crowds of people
[01:07.33] Trying to keep from looking back
[01:11.01] Got your sense on something passing
[01:15.07] And it sends me off my track
[01:29.07] 
[01:18.79] Do I find you will I follow
[01:22.59] To forever and a day
[01:26.29] I can feel you in the distance
[01:30.12] But you seem so far away
[01:42.12] 
[01:34.83] What if I just can't find my way back home (ooh)
[01:42.58] What about all the things I just don't know (ooh)
[01:50.35] What if I just can't find my way back home (ooh)
[01:57.64] Would you be there to show me where to go (ooh)
[02:21.14] 
[02:06.40] Ooooooooh
[02:10.09] Ooooooooooooooohhh
[02:19.09] 
[02:36.42] What if I just can't find my way back home (ooh)
[02:45.08] What about all the things I just don't know (ooh)
[02:52.55] What if I just can't find my way back home (ooh)
[03:00.22] Would you be there to show me where to go (ooh)
[03:23.72] 
[03:07.91] What if I just can't find my way back home (ooh)
[03:15.42] What about all the things I just don't know (ooh)
[03:23.09] What if I just can't find my way back home (ooh)
[03:30.57] Would you be there to show me where to go (ooh)
[03:54.07] 
[03:38.55] Ooooooooh
[03:42.24] Ooooooooooooooohhh
